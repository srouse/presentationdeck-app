## Presentation Deck Widget
A simple, synchronized presentation deck. Blast through your next presentation deck with page templates including a cover page, descriptor pages (full and minimized), and layout guides. Each page presents the project title, author, and date which are synchronized to all pages on any update. The widget also organizes itself into sequentially numbered pages for managing exports. Create a landscape legal presentation, export as pdfs (merge) and you have a document that presents well on today's 16:9 monitors as well as prints predictably.

## Page Layouts
- __Cover__. A simple cover that will present the minimum project title, author, and date.
- __Cover TOC__. A more complex cover that builds a table of contents based on your pages. Pages are automatically numbered based on their position next to each other starting from the upper left, down, then right.
- __Descriptor__. A content page with a section on the right for fuller descriptions or notes.
- __Descriptor Small__.  A content page with information about the project at the bottom.
- __Page Only__. A content page with no information for content that is larger. To name this page, you will need to first choose "Descriptor" or "Descriptor Small", name the page, then change it to "Page Only"
